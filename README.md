# Matlab_SFM_Structure_from_Motion
This project is based on relying on Matlab to write and use the SFM algorithm to achieve the 3D reconstruction of objects.

Note 1: The files with .p suffix are encrypted code that you can use comfortably on your matlab. Do what you normally do with code: help + function name, and be able to view the detailed code help I wrote (both English and Chinese versions). The file with .m suffix enables unhindered viewing of the code.

Note 2: When my paper is accepted by the journal, all unencrypted versions will be released, so stay tuned.
